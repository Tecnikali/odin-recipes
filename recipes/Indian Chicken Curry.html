        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt. Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; <br>
                partially cook the chicken in the hot oil in batches until completely browned on all sides. <br>
                Transfer browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet. <br>
                Cook and stir until onion turns soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. <br>
                Stir curry powder, cumin, turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion mixture; <br>
                allow to heat together for about 1 minute while stirring.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon salt to the mixture; <br>
                stir to combine.
            </li>
            <li>
                Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate. Pour <br>
                in 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat with the sauce. <br>
                Sprinkle garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the chicken.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the <br>
                center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer <br>
                inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). <br>
                Drizzle with lemon juice to serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
