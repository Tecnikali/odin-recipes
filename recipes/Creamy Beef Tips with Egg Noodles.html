        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds sirloin tips, cubed</li>
            <li>&frac12; yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup (such as Campbellâ€™s)</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>&frac12; cup red wine</li>
            <li>1 (1.25 ounce) package beef with onion soup mix</li>
            <li>2 (16 ounce) packages egg noodles</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute beef sirloin tips with onion in <br> 
                the hot skillet until beef is browned, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir cream of mushroom soup, milk, red wine, and beef with onion soup mix <br>
                together in a bowl, pour into the skillet, and stir to coat beef in the soup mixture; <br>
                bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, place a cover on the skillet, and cook until <br>
                the beef tips are tender, about 2 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce heat to lowest setting and continue cooking until the beef pulls apart <br>
                easily with a fork, at least 4 hours more.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling <br>
                water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 <br>
                minutes. Drain.
            </li>
