        <p>
            Chicken Sloppy Joes are a twist on the classic Sloppy Joe, made with ground <br>
            chicken instead of beef. The dish features a savory, slightly sweet tomato-based <br>
            sauce, often including ingredients like ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, mustard,<br>
            and seasonings. Served on a soft hamburger bun, Chicken Sloppy Joes are a <br>
            lighter yet flavorful comfort food option, perfect for quick and easy meals.

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add vegetable oil to a saucepan, and then add (in this order) garlic, yellow <br>
                onion, brown sugar, kosher salt, black pepper, cayenne, chicken thighs, <br>
                ketchup, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place over high heat and wait until you can hear the garlic sizzling in the bottom <br>
                of the pan, about 30 seconds. Let garlic sizzle for about 30 seconds before <br>
                adding the water. Stir everything together and wait for the mixture to boil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until the chicken falls apart, <br>
                about 1 &frac12; hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the green onions and peppers and cook until the peppers just turn tender,
                3 to 5 minutes more. Taste for seasoning.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from heat and serve on toasted hamburger buns.
            </li>
        </ol>
