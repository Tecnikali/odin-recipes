            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>

            <li>&frac14; teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>

            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until dissolved; set aside.<br>
                Combine soy sauce, sugar, mirin, ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes together<br> 
                in a saucepan over medium heat until the mixture starts to simmer.<br>
                Slowly whisk in cornstarch mixture. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low,<br>
                and simmer until thickened, stirring often, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pat chicken dry with paper towels; arrange in a baking dish. <br>
                Pour sauce over chicken breasts, coating all sides.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake chicken breasts in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center <br>
                and the juices run clear, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted <br>
                into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).
            </li>
        </ol>
